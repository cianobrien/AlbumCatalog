<h1>AudioFiles</h1>

This website lets users create a profile with a unique username, a profile picture, and a user bio. On their profile, they can list the albums that they have listened to, and hopefully eventually rate them. The home page lists the albums on the website alphabetically by artist, and then by the year that the artist released them. If you hover over an album cover on the home page, you can click on it to go to the album's profile, which gives more information on the album. If an album is not on the website already, a user can add it to the database using the "Add Album" link in the sidebar. 

Users can also look at other users profiles to see what they have been listening to. They cannot, however, delete or edit albums. Only the admins can do this. This is to stop users from trying to delete all albums or change the albums information to be incorrect.
